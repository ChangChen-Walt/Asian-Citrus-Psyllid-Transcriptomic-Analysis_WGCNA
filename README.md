# Asian Citrus Psyllid Transcriptomic Analysis Using WGCNA

In this repo, the code achieves following outcomes

* Detect transcriptional shifts in Diaphorina citri during Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus infection
* Apply the weighted gene co-expression network analysis to 2,1345 genes using WGCNA
* Implement differential expression analysis to obtain 743 genes using DESeq2
* Analyze functional enrichment data with GOanna, InterProScan and KOBAS

This project was accepted as conference proceedings by 1st International Electronic Conference on Entomology (IECE) in July 2021 and the manuscript is included.
