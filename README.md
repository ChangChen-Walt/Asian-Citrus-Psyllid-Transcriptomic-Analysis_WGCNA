# Project: Leveraging Co-Expression Network Analysis to Establish Transcriptional Shifts in the Gut of the Asian Citrus Psyllid During Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus Infection

## Overview
This project aims to understand the changes in gene expression in the gut of the Asian citrus psyllid during Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus infection. To achieve this, we utilized co-expression network analysis to identify genes that are co-expressed in response to CLas infection. We also investigated gene modules with correlated expression in response to CLas infection and citrus host-specific response in psyllid to CLas infection.

## Objectives
- To construct a weighted gene co-expression network to detect genes that are co-expressed in response to CLas infection.
- To identify psyllid muscle movement, peptidase activity, and iron binding associated with infection.
- To determine the hub gene annotated as participating in intracellular cargo transportation.
- To discuss gene modules with correlated expression in response to CLas infection and citrus host-specific response in psyllid to CLas infection.

## Methods
We used RNA sequencing data from the gut of Asian citrus psyllids infected with Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus. We constructed a weighted gene co-expression network using WGCNA R package. We identified hub genes and performed functional enrichment analysis using Gene Ontology (GO) terms.

## Results
Our study identified genes associated with psyllid muscle movement, peptidase activity, and iron binding during Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus infection. The hub gene was annotated as participating in intracellular cargo transportation. We also discussed gene modules with correlated expression in response to CLas infection and citrus host-specific response in psyllid to CLas infection.

## Conclusion
Our study provides insights into the changes in gene expression that occur during Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus infection of Asian citrus psyllids. These findings can be applied towards developing strategies for controlling this devastating disease that affects citrus crops worldwide.
