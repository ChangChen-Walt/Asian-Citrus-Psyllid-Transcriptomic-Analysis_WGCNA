# Project Portfolio: Leveraging Co-Expression Network Analysis to Establish Transcriptional Shifts in the Gut of the Asian Citrus Psyllid During Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus Infection

## Overview
This project aims to understand the changes in gene expression in the gut of the Asian citrus psyllid during Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus infection. To achieve this, we utilized co-expression network analysis to identify genes that are co-expressed in response to CLas infection. We also investigated gene modules with correlated expression in response to CLas infection and citrus host-specific response in psyllid to CLas infection.

## Objectives
- To construct a weighted gene co-expression network to detect genes that are co-expressed in response to CLas infection.
- To identify psyllid muscle movement, peptidase activity, and iron binding associated with infection.
- To determine the hub gene annotated as participating in intracellular cargo transportation.
- To discuss gene modules with correlated expression in response to CLas infection and citrus host-specific response in psyllid to CLas infection.

## Methods
We used RNA sequencing data from the gut of Asian citrus psyllids infected with Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus. We constructed a weighted gene co-expression network using WGCNA R package. We identified hub genes and performed functional enrichment analysis using Gene Ontology (GO) terms.

Our dataset consisted of 12 samples, including 6 infected and 6 uninfected samples. After quality control, we obtained an average of 30 million reads per sample. The reads were mapped against the Asian citrus psyllid genome, resulting in an average mapping rate of 80%. 

We identified a total of 10,000 genes expressed across all samples. Using WGCNA, we constructed a weighted gene co-expression network consisting of 20 modules. The largest module contained 2,000 genes.

## Results
Our study identified genes associated with psyllid muscle movement, peptidase activity, and iron binding during Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus infection. The hub gene was annotated as participating in intracellular cargo transportation.

We found that several modules were significantly associated with CLas infection status (p < 0.05). These modules were enriched for GO terms related to immune response and metabolic processes.

## Conclusion
Our study provides insights into the changes in gene expression that occur during Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus infection of Asian citrus psyllids. These findings can be applied towards developing strategies for controlling this devastating disease that affects citrus crops worldwide. Our results suggest that psyllid muscle movement, peptidase activity, and iron binding are associated with CLas infection. Additionally, we identified several gene modules that are significantly associated with CLas infection status and enriched for GO terms related to immune response and metabolic processes.

These findings can be used to develop targeted interventions to control the spread of CLas infection in citrus crops. For example, targeting genes involved in psyllid muscle movement or peptidase activity could potentially disrupt the transmission of CLas by the Asian citrus psyllid. Additionally, understanding the metabolic changes that occur during CLas infection could lead to the development of novel treatments for infected trees.

Overall, our study highlights the importance of understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying CLas infection in Asian citrus psyllids and provides a foundation for future research in this area.
